## Demo

Demo with WAF intercepting relative access in query param.

![Demo](./img/waf.gif)

## Usage (docker-compose.yml)

See [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

1. docker-compose up
2. Go to http://localhost/website, the request is received without warnings
3. Go to http://localhost/website?test=../etc, the request is intercepted and returned with 403 Forbidden by
   owasp/modsecurity
4. You can you bypass the WAF and check attacks at http://localhost/bypass?test=../etc

## How it works

This is a very simple plugin that proxies the query to the owasp/modsecurity apache container.

The plugin checks that the response from the waf container hasn't an http code > 400 before forwarding the request to
the real service.

If it is > 400, then the error page is returned instead.

The *dummy* service is created so the waf container forward the request to a service and respond with 200 OK all the
time.

## Configuration

This plugin supports these configuration:

* `modSecurityUrl`: (**mandatory**) it's the URL for the owasp/modsecurity container.
* `timeoutMillis`: (optional) timeout in milliseconds for the http client to talk with modsecurity container. (default 2
  seconds)
* `unhealthyWafBackOffPeriodSecs` (optional) the period, in seconds, to backoff if calls to modsecurity fail. Default to 0. Default behaviour is to send a 502 Bad Gateway when there are problems communicating with modsec.
* `remediationResponseHeader`: (optional) name of the header to add to the response when requests are blocked by ModSecurity. The header value will contain the HTTP status code returned by ModSecurity. Default is empty (no header added).

## Local development (docker-compose.local.yml)

See [docker-compose.local.yml](docker-compose.local.yml)

`docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up` to load the local plugin
